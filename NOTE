instruction < basic block < function

---

instruction
 - adhoc data structure

 flow edge
  - connect two instructions

---

basic block
 - list of instruction
 - instructions between two basic block leaders
     (including the former, excluding the later)

 basic block leader
  - the program's entry point
  - the program's first instruction (lexical order)
  - instruction targeted by a branching instruction
  - instruction following a branching instruction
  - instruction targeted by a calling instruction
  - instruction following a calling instruction

 call site
  - basic block ending by a call

 return site
  - basic block following a call site
      (lexical successor of a call site)

 unknown basic block
  - used as target for unresolved branching
  - in each function that contains unresolved branching

 control flow edge
  - connect two basic blocks
  - represent possible control flow
  - connect the unknown block node to possible targets of unresolved branching

 call edge
  - connect call site to the entry point of the called function
  - connect the unknown function node to possible targets of unresolved calls

 return edge
  - connect exit of a function to the corresponding return sites

---

function
 - graph of basic block
 - basic blocks between a call target and a return instruction
     (including both)

 function exit
  - function unique exit node
      (virtual basic block)

 unknown function
  - target of unresolved function calls
